- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Wito<br /> <br />Iâ€™m from Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, and my goal is actually to make something that changes the whole world. Based in Jerez, I started this adventure when I was 13 years old. HTML was the first coding language I touchedâ€”not really coding, actuallyâ€”but soon I started my real coding journey. I discovered Node.js (at this moment I hadnâ€™t even touched vanilla JS) and it was awesome for me. After that, I went into the deep origins of actual coding, learning some C++ & C. I didnâ€™t like it, not gonna lie, but it helped me so much to learn the essential basic logic of the coding world. I always knew that my place has always been essentially in the front-end and the back-end. I started to handle the development of mobile apps. Unfortunately, I did not have a Mac to test the apps and my PC wasnâ€™t powerful enough to run any emulator, so I always dreamed about having a Mac like every pro developer. And now, bought by my own, I have the MacBook Air M4, and now is when I think my developing adventure has actually started. Sometimes I have thoughts that tell me that eventually I wasnâ€™t made for this, but then I see what I have made just as a 16-year-old boy, and I realize that itâ€™s not about skill, itâ€™s about patience, passion, and time.
